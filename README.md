# ALTITUDE üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ALT+F4


### Team Members
- Mmeber 1: Mizhab A S - MITS
- Member 2: ZAIN SULEIMAN - MITS

### Project Description
ALTITUDE is a web app that takes your height in centimeters and tells you how many pizzas, pencils, or iPhones tall you are. It ditches boring units like feet and inches for stuff you actually understand. Because honestly, who measures themselves in centimeters when they could use grillas?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People know their height in centimeters, but have no idea how that compares to a stack of pizzas or a line of pencils‚Äîand it‚Äôs ruining lives. Conversations are awkward, bios are bland, and measuring tapes are boring. The world is desperately lacking a way to express height using absurd, everyday objects‚Äîand we decided to fix that.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a web app that converts your height from centimeters into things that actually matter‚Äîlike pizzas, pencils, iPhones, and grillas. Just type in your height, and we‚Äôll instantly tell you how many toothbrushes tall you are.
It‚Äôs wildly unscientific, deeply unnecessary, and absolutely what the internet needed.
